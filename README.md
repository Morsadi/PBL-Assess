# PROJECT BASED TEACHING RUBRIC
This prototype was inspired by PBLWorks organization encouraging teachers and school leaders to use the PBL rubric to reflect on their practice and plan for professional growth.


It serves as a digital rubric for transparent tracking of PBL educator development. In addition to designing the UI on Figma, I used React with the integration of Firebase and eventually deployed it on Netlify, to create a platform for each user to add teachers, update their profile and assess their skills. Creating this fun project has been a learning curve for me as it was my first time using Firebase API and authentication in general.
