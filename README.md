# PROJECT BASED TEACHING RUBRIC
This prototype was inspired by PBLWorks organization encouraging teachers and school leaders to use the PBL rubric to reflect on their practice and plan for professional growth.

"This rubric describes beginning, developing, and Gold Standard levels for Project Based Teaching Practices for K-12 teachers and features detailed, concrete indicators that illustrate what it means to teach in a PBL environment." -- PBLWorks
